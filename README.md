# HypergraphEmbedding
The demo code for Hypergraph Embedding: Hypergraph Cut, Weighted Kernel k-means and Heat Kernel

This repositroy contains matlab implementation of the proposed _biclique kernel_ experiment for AAAI-22 paper [1].

In future, we plan to provide python implementation for biclique kernel as well.

If you use this program, please cite [1].
